## This tool will attempt to fix common Windows issues by running these Windows tasks:

1.) DISABLED SYSMAIN

2.) SYSTEM FILE CHECKER

3.) DEPLOYMENT IMAGE SERVICING AND MANAGEMENT TOOL

4.) TEMP FILE REMOVAL

5.) WINDOWS UPDATE RESET

6.) OPTIONAL Check Drive for errors and dead sectors

- SYSMAIN will be disabled because it's slowing down Windows 11.

- SFC will scan your system files for corruption and attempt to repair them automatically.

- DISM will check your Windows installation image for problems and attempt to repair it automatically.

- After these two tasks, the script will try to delete all temporary files to speed up your PC.

- After temporary file removal, Windows Update will reset to resolve most update issues.

- After Windows Update resets, you'll have a choice to run Check Drive to look for errors and dead sectors, which can speed up your drive.

- Check Drive might take anywhere from 1 hour to 2 days. If it takes longer, your drive is likely failing.

- Once all tasks are complete, your screen will turn green, and you can reboot your PC.

## Little More Information
I know some people, after running the script, may want to re-enable SYSMAIN.

So I made another script to do that.

3.) READ THE NOTICE

4.) IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE NOTICE, CLOSE THE WINDOW, OTHERWISE PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE.

5.) THE SCRIPT WILL BEGIN RUNNING AND SET EVERYTHING BACK TO DEFAULT

6.) ONCE YOU SEE IT SAY THIS "TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY." YOU'RE GOOD TO GO. PRESS ANY KEY TO CLOSE IT
